Passwords 2.0
=============

This project contains the implementation of a desktop application used to manage passwords. It encrypts and stores the password and other information related to it, such as the login ID, web address, description and other necessary information.

This is a multi-user application where each piece of data is encrypted using the user’s main password as the encryption key, which means that no one is able to access the other user’s data without their password, not even the data base administrator.

When a new record is created, a category must be attributed to it to make it easier to access it later. The records are displayed in a tree view component on the left panel separated by categories. All the user has to do is click the record and all information related to it is decrypted and displayed on the right panel.
