## Passwords 2.0

This project contains the implementation of a desktop application used to manage passwords. It encrypts and stores the password and other information related to it, such as the login ID, web address, description and other necessary information.

This is a multi-user application where each piece of data is encrypted using the user’s main password as the encryption key, which means that no one is able to access the other user’s data without their password, not even the data base administrator.

When the apligacion is open, a login window is displayed.
